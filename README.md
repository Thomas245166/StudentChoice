There are also added interaction within the VR enviroment with the addition of HTC hand controllers.

  Vr roller coaster are a relatively new attraction with the first one opening in 2015. This is mainly due to not only space requirements but also network and hardware requirements. Other iterations of this concept can be identified as flight similators or even immobile coaster simulators. This technology is also present on rail car systems used to augmented tours or rides.

  Current the only place where you can experience this ride is in Koyto, Tokyo. Within the country is a VR arcade called VR ZONE: Shinjuku. It is the first ever only VR arcade and houses 13+ different experiences. This establishment has combined many different aspects simulated expiernces by creating specialized gear and hardware. This allows for the ability to create incredibly immersively enviroments in a very small area. Currently these enviroments require very speaicalized equipment so it offers very little expansion or alternitive use.
