### Mariokart GP VR

## Overview

  Mariokart GP VR is a virtual reality experience where the player is put onto a mechanical kart with a HTC Vive Headset. The idea is to allow for full immersion by simulating the movement of the kart while displaying the Mariokart game on the headset. There are also added interaction within the VR enviroment with the addition of HTC hand controllers.

  Vr roller coaster are a relatively new attraction with the first one opening in 2015. This is mainly due to not only space requirements but also network and hardware requirements. Other iterations of this concept can be identified as flight similators or even immobile coaster simulators. This technology is also present on rail car systems used to augmented tours or rides.

  Current the only place where you can experience this ride is in Koyto, Tokyo. Within the country is a VR arcade called VR ZONE: Shinjuku. It is the first ever only VR arcade and houses 13+ different experiences. This establishment has combined many different aspects simulated expiernces by creating specialized gear and hardware. This allows for the ability to create incredibly immersively enviroments in a very small area. Currently these enviroments require very speaicalized equipment so it offers very little expansion or alternitive use.

## How it Works

  The game is rendered within the HTC Vive headset which tracks your head position. This is the main component as it contains all visual and audio information. Coupled with the headset is the kart itself. The kart is rigged to a mechanical rail system which can simulate interia and directional changes, for example if the driver were to slam the brakes the kart will simulate the inertia pushback and lurch forward. The final compoent are the HTC Vive controllers which allow for direct manuipluation of the virtual enviroment. While in the game the driver has the ability to reach out and grab items floating in mid air and either throw or swing at opposing drivers. Currently the arcade system moves through a varitey of different tracks from the mariokart francise and features only three weapons.
  
  All three of these compoents allows for a truely immerisive experience. Due to the size of the Nintendo Corperation, many often unlicensed products tend to be created then abadoned after a ciese and desist order is issued so a unique characteristc of MarioKart GP VR is the fact that it is a fully licensed product. This is the only one of its kind and is an natural step further in the creation of new VR experiences. Some of the key features which I think help improve the expericence is the multiplayer aspect as well as the need to both drive the kart and aim at the same time which is present in no other Mariokart game. 
 
## Strenght vs Weakness

  Some strengths of this system is the implmented multiplayer function, as mariokart is a highly competive game. So not only do you have to ability to race against your friends but you also get the added pleasure of pelting them with virtual weapons. The level of immersion this arcade ride implements is nothing shy of remarkable. 
  
  However these strengths dont come without weaknesses, one being the price tag. A ticket to VR ZONE:Shinjuku will run about $40 USD and that only allows for four out of the 13+ attractions. Second is the lack of accessiablity, due to the arcade being located in japan and relying heaviely on very speacialized equipment. Many other games offer the abiltiy to be ran from home with your headset, this is not the case for these arcade rides. This greatly reduces the number of potential customers. However, the arcade is not entirely vacant, in Japan the nintendo brand is very prominent so many people visit this VR acade daily. This steady stream of customers requries the arcade to reserve attractions in advance and even run out of entry door tickets preventing sontanous adveture seekers access to the arcade.
  
  Overall however many of the people who go often leave exetremely satified with their decisions. The 4 attractions you get range in duration with the most running for about 15 minutes, this allows for breaks inbetween sessions to reduce all negative side effects. I would rate this single experience a 4 out of 10. Motion sickness due to the movement of the kart and vertigo during the level transitions are the key issues of worry for newcomers. 
  
  
## Simular Applications

  VR ZONE: Shinjuku has 13+ plus attractions all boosting very similar levels of immerision. As an arcade this technology has room to expand into other games and rides but unforutenatly the equipment becomes obsolate if the ride ever shuts down to the level of speacializaton. Repurposing the hardware may prove very difficult resulting in revune loss if the attractions are changed frequently

## Conclusion

  This VR Arcade is offering unique cutting edge technology which is exetremely marketable to the asian markets. The backing of the offical nintendo brand is greatly improving its uniqueness while offering the competitive angle will keep intrest in the arcade and is extremely fun for the driver.
